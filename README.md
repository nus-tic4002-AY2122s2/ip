## Introduction
 Duke is a Personal Assistant Chatbot that helps the user keep track of various tasks. These tasks include ToDos, Deadlines and events.
 The user would be able to input various commands in order execute the different features. If the commands are incorrect, an error message would be displayed.
 
## Features 
The main features would be commands related to the tasks. For the specialised tasks, ToDo has only a description.
Deadlines consist of a description and a due date. Events consist of a description of task and a time period. Features such as save and load happen automatically upon opening or closing the application.
If the folder ("\data") and file ("tasks_list.txt") were not created, the application will create them.

List of Features:
