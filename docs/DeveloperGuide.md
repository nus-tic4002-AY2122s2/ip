Charles, 
22, Male, University student. Having school, relationship and family commitments.  
As a computing student, he is comfortable with command line and is an expert typist with impressive typing speed and accuracy. He needs a software to keep track of the day-to-day activities. 


### User Stories

2. As a user, I can add todo, event and deadline tasks.
3. As a user, I can delete tasks so that the task list is not cluttered. 
4. As a user, I can mark a task as done so that I can track the progress.
5. As a careless user, I can undo the previous command so that the correct task list can be quickly recovered. 
6. As a user, I can terminate the program.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. The users are app-savvy. 
2. The program should respond within 1 second after the command is inputed.
