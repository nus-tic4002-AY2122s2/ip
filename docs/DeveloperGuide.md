### Design

**Duke Command Line Application** consists of a total five Java classes, namingly **Duke, Command, Parser, Task and Storage**. 

It makes optimal use of Java Stream and the latest java time APIs, e.g. LocalDateTime and LocalDate, among others, together with a judicious choice of data structures, to allow a single user to create and manage tasks fast:

- Each task  entry is stored in `data/tasks.txt` data structure.

- The **Task** class will capture all tasks input by the user.

- Data structure, `Arraylist<Task>`, chosen for efficient search/retrieval, is used to store a list of tasks.

## Product scope
**Target user profile:**

- has a need to manage a number of tasks
- prefer desktop apps vs other types
- can type fast
- comfortable using the keyboard and mouse interactions
- is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Target user:**

User: Felicia

Age: 18 (typical)

Occupation: Student

Education: Currently in Poly or JC

Commitments: CCAs, recreational activities, Studies

Traits: Is technologically literate, active in activities, comfortable typing commands

Our target user is a Student that is currently schooling. As an active student, the Target User has multiple tasks that may be hard to keep track of. 

With the help of Duke, Felicia will be able to manage her tasks smoothly.


### Value proposition


Duke provides a user-friendly, consistent and error-free interface, as well as helpful message feedback or alerts to users, throughout the app use. 

Using the CLI-type interface, the user will be able to manage tasks easily with minimal commands / single commands.

Users are able to create, update, delete, view, and find task in real-time using this application.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Users are able to run the application as long as Java11 is installed
2. The application has been designed to handle up to 100â€™s of task optimally without affecting its performance.
3. The application should preferably be executable on Windows OS or compatible software-emulated terminal.
4. User-friendly features incorporated in helpful messages feedback and diagnostic prompts (more to come)
