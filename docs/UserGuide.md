## Features

### Task Types
There are 3 types of task that Duke recognizes â€“ Todo, Event and Deadline:
+ Todo is a simple task with title only;
+ Event is a task with a date and a time range (e.g. `/at 2022-01-04 1700-1925`);
+ Deadline is a task with due date and time (e.g. `/by 2022-01-20 945`).

### Operations
Besides creation of the above mentioned tasks, Duke provides basic functionalities to manipulate the tasks, such as:
+ list all the tasks
+ list all the command keywords
+ mark one or multiple tasks done at once
+ delete one or multiple tasks done at once
+ find tasks that contains certain keywords

`Update 2022-Feb:`
+ [add tasks with tags](UserGuide.md#todo---Add-Todo)
+ [tag existing task](UserGuide.md#tag---Append-tags-to-a-task)
+ [find tasks with certain tag](UserGuide.md#Only-filter-by-a-tag)

### Storage
The program will create a `./data` folder (under same directory where user stores the `jar` file), under which a text file called `duke.txt` will store the tasks in plain text. So when the program starts next time, all the record can be read and retrived.
